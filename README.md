# Abstract
While multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows great promise in assist-ing with prostate cancer diagnosis and localization, subtle differences in appearan ce between cancerand normal tissue lead to many false positive and false negative interpretations by radiologists. Wesought to automatically detect aggressive cancer (Gleason pattern â‰¥ 4) and indolent cancer (Gleasonpattern 3) on a per-pixel basis on MRI to facilitate the targeting of aggressive cancer during biopsy.

**Methods:** We created the Stanford Prostate Cancer Network (SPCNet), a convolutional neural net-work model, trained to distinguish between aggressive ca ncer, indolent cancer, and normal tissue onMRI. Ground truth cancer labels were obtained by registering MRI with whole-mount digitalhistopathology images from patients who underwent radical prostatectomy. Before registration, thesehistopathology images were automatically annotated to show Gleason patterns on a per-pixel basis.The model was trained on data from 78 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy and 24 patientswithout prostate cancer. The model was evaluated on a pixel and lesion level in 322 patients, includ-ing six patients with normal MRI and no cancer, 23 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy,and 293 patients who underwent biopsy. Moreover, we assessed the ability of our model to detectclinically significant cancer (lesions with an aggressive component) and compared it to the perfor-mance of radiologists.

**Results:** Our model detected clinically significant lesions with an area under the recei ver operatorcharacteristics curve of 0.75 for radical prostatectomy patients and 0.80 for biopsy patients. More-over, the model detected up to 18% of lesions missed by radiologists, and overall had a sensitivityand specificity that approached that of radiologists in detecting clinically significant cancer.
Our SPCNet model accurately detected aggressive prostate cancer. Its performanceapproached that of radiologists, and it helped ident ify lesions otherwise missed by radiologists. Ourmodel has the potential to assist physicians in specifically targeting the aggressive component ofprostate cancers during biopsy or focal treatment.

## Dataset
Our study included patients data from two independent cohorts acuqired at Stanford Medicine, and it can not be shared at the moment. A detailed description of the training data can be found on the paper. For further information, please contact Dr.Mirabela Rusu ([Mirabela@stanford.edu](Mirabela@stanford.edu)).

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8
- TensorFlow 2.0
- SimpleITK 2.0.0
- scikit-image
- scikit-learn

## Installation
 Please clone the repo as follows:
 
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/PIMED/SPCNet/
 cd SPCNet
```
To run the code without any OS comaptiablity issue the `environment.yml` is already exported (Windows 10). You can create the the same enviroment as following:
 ```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate pytorch_env
```


## Train SPCNET On Your Data
To train SPCNET on your data, you can run train.py file as following:
 
 ```python -u train.py --output_filepath OUTPUT_FOLDER  --t2_filepath  T2_FOLDER --adc_filepath ADC_FOLDER --mask_filepath ADC_T2_FOLDER --all_cancer_filepath CANCER_FOLDER_LABEL --agg_cancer_filepath AGGRESIVE_LABEL FOLDER --ind_cancer_filepath INDOLET_LABEL_FOLDER```
 

## Evaluate
We have evaluated the accuracy performance of SPCNET for indolent/aggressive cancer detection on three different levels, including patient-level, lesion-level, and pixel-level accuracy.

To test the trained model and compute the different metrics for all the levels, you can run the evaluation.py file as following:

```python -u evaluation.py --output_filepath OUTPUT_FOLDER  --t2_filepath  T2_FOLDER --adc_filepath ADC_FOLDER --mask_filepath ADC_T2_FOLDER all_cancer_filepath CANCER_FOLDER_LABEL --agg_cancer_filepath AGGRESIVE_LABEL FOLDER --ind_cancer_filepath INDOLET_LABEL_FOLDER ```
